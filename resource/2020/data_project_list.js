        "Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer in women. When cancers are found early, they can often be cured. There are some devices that detect the breast cancer but many times they lead to false positives, which results is patients undergoing painful, expensive surgeries that were not even necessary. These type of cancers are called benign which do not require surgeries and we can reduce these unnecessary surgeries by using Machine Learning. I have taken the dataset of the previous breast cancer patients and train the model to predict whether the cancer is benign or malignant. These predictions will help doctors to do surgeries only when the cancer is malignant, thus reducing the unnecessary surgeries for woman. For building the project I have used Wisconsin Breast cancer data which has 569 rows of which 357 are benign and 212 are malignant. The data is prepossessed and scaled. I have trained with Random forest Classifier gives best accuracy of 95.0%. To provide the easy to use interface to doctors I have developed a website that will take the data and display the output with accuracy and time taken to predict.",

Statistics and Econometrics help in building better models and understanding the data. They can help in better feature engineering, and better understanding of the assumptions which can help in ultimately building better models. Running linear regression sounds easy but what if someone asks you what assumptions you made while running the model. If your answer is 'Umm...' then you are on the track to understanding what these topics can contribute to ML (if you didn't already know).",

This module should be tested for React Native application if not make it compatible so it can be used cross-platform. Improve the documentation of the module.   2) React-Dark toggles only between two different themes but as per the trend in the industry if a project can have an option to set multiple themes it would be really great support for many applications.

We are working on providing an app for women which analyses the user location and surroundings and with a little input of behavioural analysis, we can estimate the probability of a women to be in a safe environment or prone to be under threat. Extra features like SOS, Instant recording, police siren(to drive away the danger), booking cabs and custom shake which user can a functionality to be available at hand.Women Safety App constantly shares the user’s location to the backend where the backend analyzes if the user is presently in a dense area or is alone in a very less populated zone or in an unused area via the google traffic analysing API.Contains a dashboard that contains all the important Action Buttons like SOS, InstantRecorder, Police Siren, Instant image capture, nearby police stations, instant Taxi/Cab booking, and most important a custom shake button to alert the application to automatically perform the emergency tasks while in danger. In the event the user doesn't give consent for their location being monitored, the app just functions as a safety and Self-defense app with various protections features which can make the app in action either on rapid shake while in emergency or by custom use by the user. While focusing on the idea for future developments, we want to proceed with WatchOS application as wearables are the near future and the technology is easily available at hand for users.

This project solves that problem, now the teachers globally could register on it by making a profile using Google login, and then telling about their qualifications, experience, teaching style, and locality. It sends a welcome and a farewell email to the teacher's mail ID with which they are logged in, when they create and delete their profile. Students could go to the same platform and filter the list of teachers on the basis of their locality, subjects they want to learn, and the class they are in. Moreover, if any teacher wants to edit the details of their profile then it is also possible, after clicking on the edit profile button a form with the existing details opens, now he/she could edit the details at their comfort and submit the form.",

Moreover, the platform plans on acting as a helping hand to individuals who are preparing for the coding interviews, providing them with real live interview experience. A distinguished point for the users is the application distinction feature that we provide to our users. This entails the bifurcation of projects based on the categorical arrangement in the language in which the code is written and its implementation for example, as kotlin links to android as python links to machine learning. The user will be able to save the repository that he/she wishes to explore more in their dashboard. The UI provides the user with the number of PR’s and issues in the repository that he/she is viewing. We are also expanding into the field of AI. We are aiming at making a feature on the platform that allows the student looking to intern under a professor to select a professor by assisting them with the professor's field of study, research papers and field of expertise, assigning each of his papers with specific tags given by the model and an abstract about each paper. Further we are opening a whole new avenue for the professors who are bombarded with emails from students willing to under him/her. This will be done by a list based on the professor's requirements from the student on the basis of his/her profile containing the skills, GPA, field of interest in a well categorised format created by them. In-short we are bridging the gap between a professor and a student, To enable screen reader support, press Ctrl+Alt+Z To learn about keyboard shortcuts, press Ctrl+slash",

        "Our project intends to make it easier for a person with any challenge of sight, hearing or physical amputation to attend online classes, webinars or courses. It captures the audio, unique screenshots and generates lecture notes during any online class, conference, etc. The audio is converted to text and a file containing its summary in .txt format as well as a braille scripted file is saved. The audio files can be used by a blind person for taking note of what happened during the class. The screenshots are stored in a PDF file and can be used by a deaf person or any other person for revisiting concepts they might have missed during a class. A TicTacToe game that can be played with slight eye movements was also developed. This project has the potential to be upgraded to a full scale application, useful for persons with disability. Contributors would have a good scope of improving the frontend UI, improving speech-to-text summarization using NLP, gesture control, working on backend and lots more. This project has received the likes of many people and we would love to see our idea turn into a full-scale Desktop Application at the hands of Open Source.",

To Scrape the data and use API from various social platforms and analyze and represent it according to our needs. It typically takes 52 days for hiring through many hiring channels along with traditional hiring ranges between $4k to $20k. But a referral who gets an interview has a 40% better chance of getting hired than any other sourced candidate and gets hired in 29 days. In the scenario with the referrals, hiring can be much faster with a reduction in cost per hire and a better chance of getting hired. It will make the process much faster as within some minutes the Recruiter will get the Data of Potential Candidates and thus make the hiring Process much faster, will reduce the cost of per hire and better chance for an individual to get hired. There are many peoples who lost their jobs in 2020 due the COVID-19 Pandemic and there are many IT professionals and individuals who are in urgent need of Jobs. So it will definitely help them a lot by taking their skills , experience and all the other information to the Right Person who can offer them a job. Thus establishing the connection between recruiter and job seeker faster. As the data gathered will be personal data of individuals So, we have to protect it from unfair use that's where Blockchain comes into the picture as we can put all the scraped data on Blockchain so that we cannot connect to data directly and it get stored on blockchain network and can be accessible only through smart contract.",

        "Bulk Mailer is a Mail Client web application that can be used by organizations to send bulk emails for different groups of subscribers. In general, a bulk email service is a company that allows its customers to send mass email messages to multiple lists of recipients at a specified time. With this service, you can send a single message to thousands of people on a mailing list or a personalized email to each address on a list that can be of any size.  Today, marketers prefer to use bulk email services to deliver important messages with minimal effort. Unlike junk emails sent without the recipients’ permission, bulk emails are legal marketing campaigns since the recipients subscribe to receive them. However, if bulk email marketing is not properly managed, users may consider it spam, and consequently, it may hurt sender reputation. Most of the bulk email service providers price their offerings based on the number and frequency of the emails one wants to send. But, after registering with Bulk Mailer, you can send bulk emails free of charge!  Our application has a feature-rich email builder that lets you build beautiful and responsive emails in minutes. It supports adding and using different email templates as well which ensures consistency and reduced human efforts.",

This problem can be solved by curating similar patients and swapping the kidney within themselves. This problem is called the living donor kidney exchange problem, and in most places of India, doctors solve it manually. This project aims to automate a part of this process. This project's primary focus is to provide a platform to facilitate automized inter-hospital kidney transplants.This platform allows interested hospitals to register. The doctors from the registered hospitals can create their account and add their patients' (having kidney problems) medical details to this platform. After a doctor completes this process, this platform provides two main features. The first feature is an option to view only the essential details of a patient required for a kidney transplant. Second, for a given patient, all suitable matches from all the registered hospitals are displayed. These suitable matches are ranked from best to worst.",

It has been only 6 months since this project's inception, and many of the above-mentioned features are yet to be implemented. Hence, the scope of the project is huge and there is a lot of ground to cover. Having said that, the project's features that did get implemented till now include - authentication, basic multiplayer socket-based gameplay, users can create or join games using game-ids, can check each other's profile, and also edit their profile. The roadmap of the project for the next 6 months include - creating timers for gameplay, categorizing games into Bullet, Blitz, or Rapid based on time, start implementing daily puzzle section, add blogs or video-based material on the learning section, create a record of all games by PGN, implement ranking in all the categories including puzzles, include matchmaking on the lobby based on ranking, and lastly integrate an open-sourced chess engine (possibly Stockfish) with our existing architecture for more features like analyzing games, and evaluation.
