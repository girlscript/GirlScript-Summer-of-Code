A modern learner finds a flood of resources from Google Search but doesn't always find the right resources since it's the website with the best SEO (search engine optimisation) that wins. There are so many free resources available on the internet made by experts in their field and yet we pay for outdated courses promoted by big companies and universities.  With Footsteps, we take a mentor/subject knowledge expert first approach to solve the problem. The domain experts save their learning journey with our app and browser extension & make it available for everyone else to follow. Every resource is called a 'footstep' (added in a chronological manner) and a collection of footsteps makes up a learning path. The learner can \"fork\" the learning path made by the expert and keep a track of his progress. The app suggests resources & keeps an updated list with users upvotes & collaborative filtering.  Upcoming features include: 1) Ability to make the path private/public. 2) The ability to \"fork\" a learning path & suggest changes. 3) A collaborative filtering recommendation system for recommending the right resources to a learner. 4) Ability to save your progress in a learning path.",

Travel-safe simplifies safety for women in the digital world by making it easy to stay connected to the nearest police station.  With Travel-safe: - user can create her own private group to share live location tracking whenever switched on - when the user decides to share her location, the nearest police station also gets a regular update on it. - Based on historical data, a heatmap will be created for the crime prone areas so that the user is alerted about it. Also, it will help police understand and increase patrolling in such areas identified by the system. -Collectively assistance feature that alerts all the verified people near you who are registered in the app",

        "This Organisation contains various ReactJS NPM module which can be used inside a ReactJS application to add interesting features inside any project. Presently it has two NPM modules React-Pincode and React-Dark. Each of the modules has more than 250 downloads on the official NPM website.  The detailed description of each project as follows:-  1) React-Pincode:-  provides smooth functionality in an application to autofill city and state input field as users enter a Pincode in the input field. When a user enters an invalid Pincode which doesn't exist it throws an error. The workflow of the module is when a user enters a pin code it fetches the details from official Indian postal code API which contains all the details related to the Pincode. The module fetches only city and state information and updates the fields. Ir provides a method to add CSS classes to all three input fields to make it as per the user's choice. This module is very flexible and fast. Currently, this works only for Indian Pincodes. The module uses Webpack for module bundling and Babel for compiling.  Link - https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-pincode   2) React-Dark:- is an interesting module which allows a developer to add a dark theme to any application is just a few easy and smooth steps. It provides an option to toggle between dark and light theme. It provides a flexible method to change the theme colour when required. The workflow of the module is as the user toggle the theme checkbox the CSS styles which were set for the sark theme will be applied to the whole project. The module uses Webpack for module bundling and Babel for compiling.   Link - https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dark",
      vision_for_project:
        "There is a scope of improvement in both the NPM modules. 1) React-Pincode as of now works only for Indian Pincodes. This needs to be implemented for international pin codes so that it can be used by developers globally. Improve error handling functionality of the module. This module should be tested for React Native application if not make it compatible so it can be used cross-platform. Improve the documentation of the module.   2) React-Dark toggles only between two different themes but as per the trend in the industry if a project can have an option to set multiple themes it would be really great support for many applications. Improve the flow of the module for more smooth functioning.  Improve the documentation of the module.",

With Footsteps, we take a mentor/subject knowledge expert first approach to solve the problem. The domain experts save their learning journey with our app and browser extension & make it available for everyone else to follow. Every resource is called a 'footstep' (added in a chronological manner) and a collection of footsteps makes up a learning path. The learner can \"fork\" the learning path made by the expert and keep a track of his progress. The app suggests resources & keeps an updated list with users upvotes & collaborative filtering.  Upcoming features include: 1) Ability to make the path private/public. 2) The ability to \"fork\" a learning path & suggest changes. 3) A collaborative filtering recommendation system for recommending the right resources to a learner. 4) Ability to save your progress in a learning path.",
